`Linux kernel` is the core part of the Linux operating system. It's what originally Linus wrote.
`Linux OS` is a combination of the kernel and a user-land (libraries, GNU utilities, config files, etc).
`Linux distribution` is a particular version of the Linux operating system like Debian or CentOS.
